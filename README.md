# nuTV

nuTV is intended to be a rebuild of Vexorian's [dizque-TV](https://github.com/vexorian/dizquetv), essentially rebuilding it from the ground up in Angular 15 (at the moment - we're early enough in that I'm considering React), with planned features such as revamped channel scheduling. This is a rebuild, as DizqueTV is it's own thing, and while this project is based off of it, a simple fork would require significant effort. Compatibility similar to DizqueTV's with PseudoTV is not guaranteed, though I will be attempting to keep things similar to easy migration.
